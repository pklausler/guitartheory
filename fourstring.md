# Chord construction - four tones, four strings
## Introduction
This note is a guide to quickly finding jazz chords on the guitar fretboard and altering them to form chord progressions.

The standard (`EADGBE`) tuning for six-string guitar is used throughout.
## Four-tone chords
Each chord that we'll discuss in this note comprises four tones.
1. The **root** establishes tonality.
1. The **third** is major or minor (or suspended to the fourth).
1. The **fifth** reinforces tonality and stability.  It can be *altered* by raising or lowering it by a semitone.
1. The **seventh** gives character, and can be *major*, *dominant*, or *diminished* (and then is the same as the *sixth*).

Since three of the four tones in a chord can vary, there are many possible combinations, even without adding extensions.
This note is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to harmony (there are many good sources for that!).
For our purposes here, we're going to limit ourselves just to chords that follow this pattern.
### Examples
In the key of C, we have these common four-tone chords

| chord | root | third | fifth | seventh |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 7 | C | E | G | Bb |
| M7 | C | E | G | B |
| -7 | C | Eb | G | Bb |
| -M7 | C | Eb | G | B |
| 6 | C | E | G | Bbb (A) |
| 7#5 | C | E | G# | Bb |
| -7b5 | C | Eb | Gb | Bb |
| dim7 | C | Eb | Gb | Bbb(A) |

## Four-tone chords on four adjacent strings
### Inversions
One may generally arrange the tones of a chord in any order of pitch (low to high).
With four tones, there are actually 24 possible arrangements!  Each of these is generally
called an *inversion* of the chord.
However, some inversions are easier to play than others on the guitar.
If we limit ourserlves for the moment to playing four-tone chords only on
four adjacent strings (say, the four lowest ones), it turns out that people
with normally-sized hands can reach only a few of them.
### Moving up and down on the same strings
Suppose we have found a fingering for a chord on a set of strings.
We can immediately find other inversions for that chord on the *same* set of strings by
moving each of the tones down (in pitch) until they are again on chord tones.
We can also move the tones up (in pitch) until thay are again on chord tones.
Unless we run out of room down by the nut or up by the bridge, we can find
four related inversions of a chord this way.
#### Notation
I'll describe chords for now using the names of their tones (`C-E-G-Bb`), their corresponding
roles in the chord (`1357`), and their fret position tablature on the low strings (`8-7-5-4-x-x`,
which is kind of a stretch so we won't use it).  This is a C7 chord; one can easily change
it to another four-tone chord by adjusting its third, fifth, and seventh appropriately.
Notice that I do not put sharps or flats on the chord roles -- this is the `1357` voicing.
#### Example
The C7 chord has four easy voicings on the low four strings (well, three easy and one
that seems weird at first).
The one at `C-G-Bb-E` (`8-10-8-9-x-x`) is the `1573` shape, and it should be familiar
to most guitarists.
Using the same strings, we can move this `1573` shape down to the `7351` (`Bb-E-G-C`, `6-7-5-5-x-x`)
shape by lowering each tone until it is again a tone in the chord.
The `7351` shape can itself be lowered to `5137` (`G-C-E-Bb`, `3-3-2-3-x-x`).
Moving in the other direction, the `1573` shape can be *raised* to `3715`
(`E-Bb-C-G`, `12-13-10-12-x-x`), and again to `5137` (`15-15-14-15-x-x`).
And that's the same as the `5137` we found earlier, it's just an octave higher.
### The "Buddy System"
The four voicings that we just found on four adjacent strings have an interesting property.
1. `1573`
1. `3715`
1. `5137`
1. `7351`
In each voicing, the root and the fifth appear as a pair, and so do the third and the seventh.
The pairs are never separated, although they might swap places.
## Diatonic Chord Progressions
Suppose we're playing in the key of C major.
The *diatonic* chords in C major are CM7, D-7, E-7, FM7, G7, A-7, and B-7b5.
These chords have generic names in Roman numerals: IM7, II-7, III-7, IVM7, V7, VI-7, and VII-7b5.

Suppose that we're playing a CM7 chord (`C-E-G-B`, IM7) and want to move to A-7 (`A-C-E-G`, VI-7).
Those chords are pretty similar -- they share three of their four tones.
So we can change CM7 to A-7 by simply dropping the seventh (`B`) of CM7 to become the root (`A`) of A-7.

In terms of chord voicings: if we're playing the CM7 as a `1573` on four adjacent strings,
we drop the `7` two frets and we then have
