# Chord construction - four voices, four strings
## Introduction
This note is a guide to quickly finding jazz chords on the guitar fretboard and altering them to form chord progressions.

The standard (`EADGBE`) tuning for six-string guitar is used throughout.
## Four-voice chords
Each chord that we'll discuss in this note comprises four tones.
1. The **root** establishes tonality.
1. The **third** is major or minor (or suspended to the fourth).
1. The **fifth** reinforces tonality and stability.  It can be *altered* by raising or lowering it by a semitone.
1. The **seventh** gives character, and can be *major*, *dominant*, or *diminished* (and then is the same as the *sixth*).

Since three of the four tones in a chord can vary, there are many possibilities, even without adding extensions.
This note is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to harmony (there are many good sources for that!).
For our purposes here, we're going to limit ourselves just to chords that follow this pattern.
