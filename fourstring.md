# Chord construction - four tones, four strings
## Introduction
This note is a guide to quickly finding jazz chords on the guitar fretboard and altering them to form chord progressions.

The standard (`EADGBE`) tuning for six-string guitar is used throughout.
## Four-tone chords
Each chord that we'll discuss in this note comprises four tones.
1. The **root** establishes tonality.
1. The **third** is major or minor (or suspended to the fourth).
1. The **fifth** reinforces tonality and stability.  It can be *altered* by raising or lowering it by a semitone.
1. The **seventh** gives character, and can be *major*, *dominant*, or *diminished* (and then is the same as the *sixth*).

Since three of the four tones in a chord can vary, there are many possible combinations, even without adding extensions.
This note is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to harmony (there are many good sources for that!).
For our purposes here, we're going to limit ourselves just to chords that follow this pattern.
### Examples
In the key of C, we have these common four-tone chords

| chord | root | third | fifth | seventh |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| C7 | C | E | G | Bb |
| CM7 | C | E | G | B |
| C-7 | C | Eb | G | Bb |
| C-M7 | C | Eb | G | B |
| C6 | C | E | G | Bbb (A) |
| C7#5 | C | E | G# | Bb |
| C-7b5 | C | Eb | Gb | Bb |
| Cdim7 | C | Eb | Gb | Bbb(A) |

You'll see other symbols for these chords in some lead sheets are harmony texts;
the notation is not as well standardized as it could be.

## Four-tone chords on four adjacent strings
### Inversions
One may generally arrange the tones of a chord in any order of pitch (low to high).
With four tones, there are actually 24 possible arrangements!  Each of these is generally
called an *inversion* of the chord.
However, some inversions are easier to play than others on the guitar.
If we limit ourserlves for the moment to playing four-tone chords only on
four adjacent strings (say, the four lowest ones), it turns out that people
with normally-sized hands can reach only a few of them.
### Moving up and down on the same strings
Suppose we have found a fingering for a chord on a set of strings.
We can immediately find other inversions for that chord on the *same* set of strings by
moving each of the tones down (in pitch) until they are again on chord tones.
We can also move the tones up (in pitch) until thay are again on chord tones.
Unless we run out of room down by the nut or up by the bridge, we can find
four related inversions of a chord this way.
#### Notation
I'll describe chords for now using the names of their tones (`C-E-G-Bb`), their corresponding
roles in the chord (`1357`), and their fret position tablature on the low strings (`8-7-5-4-x-x`,
which is kind of a stretch so we won't use it).  This is a C7 chord; one can easily change
it to another four-tone chord by adjusting its third, fifth, and seventh appropriately.
Notice that I do not put sharps or flats on the chord roles -- this is the `1357` voicing.
#### Example
The C7 chord has four easy voicings on the low four strings (well, three easy and one
that seems weird at first).
The one at `C-G-Bb-E` (`8-10-8-9-x-x`) is the `1573` shape, and it should be familiar
to most guitarists.
Using the same strings, we can move this `1573` shape down to the `7351` (`Bb-E-G-C`, `6-7-5-5-x-x`)
shape by lowering each tone until it is again a tone in the chord.
The `7351` shape can itself be lowered to `5137` (`G-C-E-Bb`, `3-3-2-3-x-x`).
Moving in the other direction, the `1573` shape can be *raised* to `3715`
(`E-Bb-C-G`, `12-13-10-12-x-x`), and again to `5137` (`15-15-14-15-x-x`).
And that's the same as the `5137` we found earlier, it's just an octave higher.
### The "Buddy System"
The four voicings that we just found on four adjacent strings have an interesting property.
1. `1573`
1. `3715`
1. `5137`
1. `7351`

In each voicing, the root and the fifth appear as a pair, and so do the third and the seventh.
The pairs are never separated as we move up or down on the same set of strings, although the
two pairs exchange places, and the two notes in one pair will swap order.

There's another cool property of these four voicings: each tone appears in each of the four
positions.  So if we need a voicing with (say) the third in the lowest position, it's
immediately identifiable (`3715`).
If we wanted to, we could name these four voicings just by their lowest tones, their
highest tones, by the position of the root in the inversion, or another tone.
This becomes useful when we consider voice leading below.
## Diatonic Chord Progressions
Suppose we're playing in the key of C major.
The *diatonic* chords in C major are CM7, D-7, E-7, FM7, G7, A-7, and B-7b5.
These chords have generic names in Roman numerals: IM7, II-7, III-7, IVM7, V7, VI-7, and VII-7b5.
### Nearest Neighbors
Suppose that we're playing a CM7 chord (`C-E-G-B`, IM7) and want to move to A-7 (`A-C-E-G`, VI-7).
Those chords are pretty similar -- they share three of their four tones.
So we can change CM7 to A-7 by simply dropping the seventh (`B`) of CM7 to become the root (`A`) of A-7.

In terms of chord voicings: if we're playing the CM7 on any four strings,
we can drop its seventh (`B`) two frets to become the root (`A`) of A-7.
For example, CM7's `5137` at `G-C-E-B` (`3-3-2-4-x-x`) becomes A-7's `7351` at `G-C-E-A` (`3-3-2-2-x-x`).
This works for *any* voicing of a CM7 chord.

So the VI is the near neighbor *below* the I.  The near neighbor *above* the I is the III,
which is found by raising the root (`C` in CM7) to become the seventh (`D` in E-7).
Specifically, CM7's `1573` at `C-G-B-E` (`8-10-9-9-x-x`) becomes E-7's `7351` at `D-G-B-E` (`10-10-9-9-x-x`).
## Other Neighbors
We can change the I to a VII or III by moving a single voice down or up (respectively).
The IV and the V are also nearby, by applying the same move twice.

As we saw, we can move from the I chord to the VII by lowering its seventh to become the root of the VII.
If we do this a second time, lowering the seventh of the VII, it becomes the root of the IV.
For example, A-7's `7351` at `G-C-E-A` (`3-3-2-2-x-x`) becomes FM7's `1573` at `F-C-E-A` (`1-3-2-2-x-x`).
(This is not the best voice leading, however; see a better change below.)

In the other direction, after transforming the I chord to the III by raising its root to become the seventh,
we can raise the root of the III to become the seventh of the V.
So CM7 becomes E-7 becomes G7, for example, via its `3715` (`E-B-C-G` at `12-14-10-12-x-x`) to
E-7's `1573` (`E-B-D-G` at `12-14-12-12-x-x`) to G7's `7351` (`F-B-D-G` at `13-14-12-12-x-x`).

So we can get from I to VI to IV by lowering sevenths to become roots, and from I to III to V by raising roots
to become sevenths.
What about the two remaining diatonic chords?  The II and the VII have only one tone in common with the I, so they
are three steps away.
Specifically, I can become II via I -> VI -> IV -> II, and I can become VII via I -> III -> V -> VII.

## Better voice leading
When a chord progression resolves by changing the V to the I (usually V7 -> IM7), we could do it
with this method by lowering the seventh and the fifth of the V to become the third and the root
of the I (e.g., G7's `7351` at `F-B-D-G` (`13-14-12-12-x-x`) to CM7's `3715` at `E-B-C-G` (`12-14-10-12-x-x`)).
But it really sounds better to resolve the V7 to the I by raising the third of the V7 to become the
root of the I -- the third of the V7 is the *leading tone* that sits just one fret below the root of the I.

Let's figure this out in our little system of staying on the same set of four strings.
Suppose that we want to end up with a resolution at CM7's `5137` at `G-C-E-B` (`3-3-2-4-x-x`).
The leading tone is on the same string as CM7's root, one fret lower in pitch, so it's
the B at `x-2-x-x-x-x`.
That's the third of some form of G7, and as was mentioned above, that form is unique:
it has to be G7's `7351` at `F-B-D-G` (`1-2-0-0-x-x`).

So the voicings that resolve via raising the leading tone are

| V7  | to I |
| --- | ---- |
| `3715` | `1573` |
| `5137` | `3715` |
| `7351` | `5137` |
| `1573` | `7351` |

There's a pattern here that's useful to spot: for any given voicing of the I chord, the
voicing of its V with a good leading tone can be found by raising the tones of the I
up one position, then using that pattern as the voicing for the V.

(Another good way to resolve V to the I via raising the leading tone is to play the
`5137` voicing of the V and then shift it higher by one *string* to become the `5137` of the I.)

One can apply similar techniques to use leading tones in II-V-I progressions, since the
II is the V of the V.
## Four tones on sets of five and six strings
The same buddy system (roots pair with fifths, thirds pair with sevenths) applies if we
introduce an unplayed string between the two pairs; however, the two tones in one pair
are swapped.
In particular, we have these four basic patterns:
1. `15x37`
1. `37x51`
1. `51x73`
1. `73x15`

As was the case with our original four patterns, each of these can be raised up or lowered
down to become another in the collection, and raising up four times (or lowering) gets one
to the same pattern, one octave higher or lower.

Obviously we can use these only on two sets of five strings on a six-string guitar.

Another way of deriving these patterns is to realize that the tone that used to be on the string that
we're now skipping has been raised an octave.
This is a useful transformation -- it makes the harmonization "broader".
One can change any of our original four patterns (so long as they're not being played on the topmost
four strings!) by one of these by moving one tone, and vice versa.

It's also possible to spread out our original four voicings in two other ways, of course.
These are
1. `1x735` and `157xx3`
1. `3x157` (but not `371xx5`, unless you have very long and flexible fingers!)
1. `5x371` and `513xx7`
1. `7x513` and `735xx1`

And there's also `13xx57` and `57xx13`, which break up our usual buddy system, but are very
much worth knowing if only because the `13xx57` form of the M7 chord is so beautiful on the
guitar (e.g., CM7 as `C-E-x-x-G-B` or `8-7-x-x-8-7`).
